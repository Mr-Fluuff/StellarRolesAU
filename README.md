# Changelog

## Version 2024.12.5 - LATEST
    
**Patch Notes**

Updated to Among Us v2024.11.26

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed view settings menu to show appropriate colors and fixed it showing blank values
- Fixed fake heart on end screen when a player was disconnected
- Fixed Detective breaking the game
- Fixed zoom sometimes breaking game for ghost on meeting call
- Fixed Imposter chat icon color flashing randomly
- Fixed Unreportable bodies when they would be pushed up against a game object
- Updated help cards to load faster and take up less memory space
- Fixed Parasite movement to be client sided instead of server sided. This will drastically improve the way you play now as there is little to no movement lag!!

**New Things**

- Added a New Role!!! Charlatan is a new impostor role that can deceive the crew!! Lower report range of bodies and self report away from a body!! Check out more in the Help Card!
- Added a new Detective prompt. If a body is was Dragged (Undertaker), Decayed (Parasite), or Deceived (Charlatan), a new prompt will be put into the strong info group (More likely to get this on a body rather than a crime scene)
- Reworked how you get detective prompts. There are 2 Groups. Group A is strong info. Group B is not as strong info. On a body you will always get 3 A and 1 B prompts in a random order. On a crime scene will be 3 B and 1A.
- Adjusted Role assignment to hopefully be more random. (If your imp 4 times in a row that's just bad luck) :(
- Added a New Christmas/Holidays Custom lobby and banner!!! Thank you Seagirl13!!! We love our artists
- Added a few new custom sounds for certain roles o.o. My fav is scavenger eat. :D More of these to be added in the future with a small twist.

- Added a New History Button!! After the game you will get access to this button on your screen. Clicking it will bring up last games stats and you can also check the tournament stats on this screen!
- Added a New Halloween Lobby!!! Thanks to one of our wonderful artists Seagirl13 we have a "spooky" Custom Lobby that replaces the standard lobby to the right of dropship before the game starts!! The Devs are soup :D (This lobby only shows up around Halloween times)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Mr-Fluuff/StellarRolesAU/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable `winhttp.dll` via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html#open-winecfg-for-the-target-game)
4. Launch the game via Steam

## Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

We're awaiting your creative cosmetic designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
- **Submission:** If you got a hat or visor design to submit, or you need to know how to create one, you can head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7UcvM9CFdY).

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.

# Impostor Roles

## Investigator
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Investigator can see footprints that other players leave behind them.\
If the Investigator reports a body, they are shown the age of the body.

**NOTE:**

- The Investigator does not see footprints of players that sit in vents

## Jailor
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Jailor is a crewmate-protective role with a meeting-based role-block ability.\
Their main ability 'Jail' can be performed once per meeting, and is earned by completing tasks to build up charges.\
When jailed, a player will have grey bars on top of their "avatar".\
A jailed player is immune to guessing, and can only guess Jailor themselves.\
\
**NOTE:**
- This role is meant to have a main focus on countering [Assassins](#assassin).
- If the Jailor is killed during a meeting, its jail will instantly break.

## Medic
### **Team: Crewmates**
StellarRoles's version of the medic is VERY different from other mods!\
The Medic has access to a mobile vitals panel at all times. However, this panel has a battery that is charged up by completing tasks. This battery charges on its own when all of the Medic's tasks are complete.\
The Medic can also place a heart monitor on another player. If that player is killed, the Medic will be notified with a flash.\
Killer of your monitored target can also be notified on a configurable delay!\
\
**NOTE**
- Initiating the Mobile Vitals Panel costs an extra 1 second of charge

## Parity Cop
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Parity Cop is a role that can compare the alignments of two other players.								
In meetings these players will be compared to one another, to see if they have the same alignment or not! The two most recently selected living players will be compared during the next meeting. The Parity Cop may use this button as much as they want per round.\
The Parity Cop also can get an ability called Fake Out. Fake out will force the Parity Cop to the top of their running comparison list. If the most recent person they have compared is a Non-Crewmate, they will see a standard comparison has been made to them with the parity cop!
\
**Notes**
- There are two categories that all players fit into: Killers, and Non-Killers.
- Mismatched players will be displayed with X's.
- Matched players will be displayed with â.
- When any Non-Crewmate role is put in a comparison with another player, they will be made aware of it in meeting with a ? next to their name, and next to the name of the person they were compared to.
- Fake Out provides no information to the Parity Cop. It is simply a way for the Parity Cop to keep their role from being singled out, as they cannot compare themselves normally.

\
**NOTE**

The Spy is a Crewmate whose goal is to deceive the Impostors.\ 
The Spy in-game has a red nickname for Impostors and will be placed with them on the Spawn screen.\
You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not.
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)

**NOTE:**
- Spy can enter but not move to connected vents

## Tracker
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Tracker has two abilities: Mark and Track.								
The Mark ability is used on players to allow the Tracker to later track them. When the tracker uses their Track ability a short delay will begin, then all marked players will have an arrow pointing to them for a set duration.\
The arrow updates its position every few seconds.\

**NOTE**
- If the tracked player is on a different floor on Submerged, the arrow will always point to the elevator
- The delay before tracking begins serves as a time window to allow the player to reposition themselves.

## Trapper
### **Team: Crewmates**

The Trapper is a role that can either cover up or place traps on vents. Traps are armed instantly, while covers take a round to be both visible and active after they are placed.\
Covered vents cannot be entered or exited through but can be traveled through. All players can see a vent cover.\
Trapped vents are invisible to all players except for venting roles who spend at least 3 seconds in close proximity to them. A revealed trap will look like the vent is shaded green.\
If a player attempts to use a trapped vent, the trap will be consumed, the Trapper and trapped player will get a green flash on their screen, and the trapped player will be stuck in place for a few seconds.\

**NOTE:**
- Cover and Trap share cooldown

## Vigilante
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Vigilante is a role that can guess the role of another player in meeting to kill them.\
If the Vigilante guesses wrong, he dies instead.\
\
**NOTE**
- To guess a player's role, click the target symbol displayed over their player icon. Click on the role you want to guess once to highlight it and again to confirm and shoot.
- You can only shoot during the voting time.
- You can't shoot during the last 10 seconds of a meeting.

## Watcher
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Watcher has access to a mobile camera panel at all times. However, this panel has a battery that is charged up by completing tasks.\
This battery periodically charges on its own when all of the Watcher's tasks are complete.\
Watcher can also place a Sensor on the map that will trigger the moment someone is near it.\
Watcher gets a flash and an arrow pointing to triggered sensor. The arrow is the color of the player who triggered it, but it can be set to be anonymous.\
\
**Notes**
- Unused sensor is cleared at the start of each round.
- Initiating the panel costs an extra 1 second of charge to do.
- The host may choose to disable battery charging and access to your mobile power in the first round of the game. This should not discourage you from doing tasks on round one, as when you finish tasks the battery will charge on its own anyway.

# Ability
Note: There is no such thing as "Ability" in this mod, but I have no idea how to categorize Assassin since it's neither a role nor a modifier.
## Assassin 
### **Team: Impostors/Neutral Killing**
The Assassin is an ability for Impostors or Neutral Killers that allows them to guess roles during meeting. If the guess is wrong, the Assassin dies instead.\
You can select how many players can be shot per game and if multiple players can be shot during a single meeting.\
The guess "Crewmate" is only right, if the player has the Vanilla Crewmate role.\
\
**NOTE:**
- To guess a player's role, click the target symbol displayed over their player icon. Click on the role you want to guess once to highlight it and again to confirm and shoot.	
- If a player you voted for gets shot, you'll get back your vote.
- The Assassin is _NOT_ a [Modifier](#modifier) meaning you can have both.
- You can only shoot during the voting time.
- You can't shoot during the last 10 seconds of a meeting.
